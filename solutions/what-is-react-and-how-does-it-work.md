# What is React and how does it work?

## Explanation
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render components based on state and props.

## Syntax
```jsx
function MyComponent() {
  return <div>Hello, React!</div>;
}
```

## Example
```jsx
import React from 'react';

function Hello() {
  return <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
}

export default Hello;
```
